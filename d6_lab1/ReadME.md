#Lab 1 - GHDL and GTKWAVE
this lab goes over the installation and setup of a basic GHDL component and simulation, with the simulation ran for viewing on gtkwave. They are both open source and free. 

The vhdl component h_add describes a half adder circuit. The following is its simulation on gtkwave.
